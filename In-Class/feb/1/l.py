# Activity 2
1) 0, when the number is the max of the array
2) the length of the array, when the number is the minimum
3) Typical insertions will end up around the middle of the
array. There will be outliers on the left and the right, but
they cancel out and give us, on average, half the values of
the list to be shifted.
4) O(n) means the amount of time an operation takes grows linearly
with the number of objects in the array. It means that as the array
gets larger, the time taken grows linearly.
5) Since, on average, inserting a value requires shifting half the values
in the array, and this is a task that grows linearly as the number of values
increases, we can argue that this operation takes O(n) time.

# Activity 3
1) "We wouldn't be able to access the list without the head pointer. It contains"
the information for the next object in the list, so we would not be able to continue
without it.
2) No, it contains the first value and the reference to the next item only.
3) We can just pass the head pointer.

# Activity 4
It needs a value and a reference. The value is the data meant to be stored in the list,
and the reference gives you the next item in the linked list.
