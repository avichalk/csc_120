# Activity 1
# If the node has a value of none, it is still taking up
# one cell in memory, it's just not holding any value in
# that cell. Therefore, an empty list will just be square
# brackets.

# cur is pointing to none

# Activity 5
# In a linked list, references aren't stored backwards
# only forwards. So you cannot go back up the list.
# However, these values are not lost forever- you could
# go to the head pointer and start moving through the list
# with cur again, and return to the values you missed.
